# Project Planning
##Research 
 Data Source 
  - From USGS data https://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?06730200
   - URL can be changed to change a request 
  - Service changing to Jan 1 2023:  https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/06730200/

## Scope 

Hardware 
 Minimum
 - standalone microcontroller 
 - Wifi connected 
 - plugs into the wall 
 - prints on thermal printer 

 Stretch goals 
  - manually enter the gate to check flow
  - custom enclosure
  - uses an oled screen for options 

Software 
 Minimum
 - pulls graph data without manual intervention 
 - convert graph to be printed on thermal paper
 - can be connectred to over wifi 
 - prints a pre-baked graph with a button press 
 - can have a graph pre programmed 

 Stretch 
 - Uses an OLED screen for selection
 - uses a keypad for manual gate entry 
 - can change duration of graph 
 - can save gates to deafult
